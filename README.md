# Kairos

This repository contains the implementation of the approach proposed 
in the paper 
"_KAIROS: Practical Intrusion Detection and Investigation using Whole-system Provenance_".

Please cite this paper if you use the model or any code
from this repository in your own work:

```

We provide a [demo](DARPA/README.md)
to illustrate step-by-step
how you can run the code end-to-end.
> Due to the extended amount of time it takes to
> train a model, we also provide pre-trained models
> of our experimental datasets.
> You can download these models directly from our [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1YAKoO3G32xlYrCs4BuATt1h_hBvvEB6C).

Our paper and [the supplementary material](supplementary-material.pdf)
contain links to all publicly available datasets used in our experiments.
